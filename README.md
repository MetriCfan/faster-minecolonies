# faster-minecolonies
speeds up research and colonists walking plus block place and break speed

this modpack decreases the time taken to complete research
it also makes the research requirements easier
it also allows you to skip certain buildings if you want e.g. dyer, florist, concrete mixer, barracks
colour recipes have been automatically added to:
sawmill (banners and beds)
stonemason (terracotta and concrete powder and concrete)
fletcher (wool and carpet)
glassblower (glass and stained glass)

important:
to get things going you need to do the woodwork research first
make a town hall, builder, forester then university band do the woodworl research
after that do whatever you please
